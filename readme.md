# Mapping Poverty from Space

Mapping poverty to better target aid and development is a difficult business for a number of reasons: the reliance on the collection of household data which is time-consuming and costly; household surveys and data are often not avail- able for many countries of interest and when they are, it is usually not at the desired frequency and this time-lag cre- ates problems in the decision making process for develop- ment and aid agencies; to get a sense of a region’s current development, it is often essential to use predictions to fill in the gap in the time-series data of that region’s economic in- dicators, which can be questionable and unreliable. Recent researches and development in the field of computer vision and deep learning have displayed the effectiveness of em- ploying publicly available satellite images to map out im- poverished areas in the sub-Saharan African region (Neal Jean et al., 2016). This studies seeks to investigate the ex- tent to which this methodology can be applied in the context of Bangladesh to predict different socioeconomic and poverty indicators.
